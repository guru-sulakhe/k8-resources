  # NodePort extends the ClusterIP service and its visibility is internal and external to the cluster. 
  # You can set a NodePort using the NodePort property, this is the port that the service will listen on from outside the cluster. 
  # There is one requirement of using NodePort which is nodes must have public IP addresses. 
  # The port must be in the range between 30000 and 32767 and if you donâ€™t specify the NodePort value Kubernetes will assign it randomly.
